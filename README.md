# Programming 2 Assignments
 All of my assignments from Programming II

How to Run
============

* To run any code, the .cpp and .h file go together, so just use any c++ compiler to compile the .cpp file and it will test both files.
* If there is no .h file to go with the .cpp, then the .cpp is a stand alone and can still be compiled on it's own.
